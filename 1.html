                <p>The ever prolific King moves from his trademark horror into the realm of the hard-boiled noir thriller.</p>
                <p>“He’s not a normal person. He’s a hired assassin, and if he doesn’t think like who and what he is, he’ll never get clear.” So writes King of his title character, whom the Las Vegas mob has brought in to rub out another hired gun who’s been caught and is likely to talk. Billy, who goes by several names, is a complex man, a Marine veteran of the Iraq War who’s seen friends blown to pieces; he’s perhaps numbed by PTSD, but he’s goal-oriented. He’s also a reader—Zola’s novel Thérèse Raquin figures as a MacGuffin—which sets his employer’s wheels spinning. It’s no spoiler to say that whereas Billy carries out the hit with grim precision, things go squirrelly, complicated by his rescue of a young woman—Alice—after she’s been roofied and raped.</p>
                <p>Murder most foul and mayhem most entertaining. Another worthy page-turner from a protean master.</p>

                                                    The master of horror hits his absolute low with this lazy adaptation of "Leon" the "Professional".  This is a very uninspiring , unnecessarily drawn out story about a hitman, saving a girl, who in turn, turns his life around and gives him a reason to live, right before he dies... There is no twists or turns that you do not see coming from a mile away. Also, the writer does not hide his political affiliations in the slightest, shoving them down your throat and making you feel like a complete scumbag, just for having a different political opinion. And don't get me started with the laziest fan service I've ever seen: is mere mentioning of "The Overlook" supposed to make us salivate?... What was the point of that?... "The Shining" was one of his best novels, and he just shoves it in here pretty much saying: "remember that you guys and how great it was, well this is just like that..." Except,  it is not... it feels very out of place, just as his political rants... Stephen King used to be my favorite author for the past 30 years, but with this blatant cash grab he managed to lose any and all respect I have had held for this once great writer.

                                                    Slow talking, quick thinking Billy Summers presents himself as a blunt instrument to the mobsters who hired Billy to kill a mark. His record speaks for itself: Never caught and never suspected, he's had clean getaways. He knows he's been clever, but also lucky. As all successful gamblers know, his luck will run out. So, this is Billy's last job before retirement. He has no intention of getting caught.

                                                    An enjoyable book. Good characters, moves along slow at times, but has decent suspense for a thriller to keep you going. Some of the plot is predictable, most is original and interesting. 
                                                    Like many others commented, the politics / liberal slant doesn't add to the story. It's not a big part of the story, but it has no place in it (please move on from trump, your best work didn't have this much overtones of politics).
