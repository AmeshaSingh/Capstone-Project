                <p>After 1,000 years of peace, whispers that “the Nameless One will return” ignite the spark that sets the world order aflame.</p>
                <p>No, the Nameless One is not a new nickname for Voldemort. Here, evil takes the shape of fire-breathing dragons—beasts that feed off chaos and imbalance—set on destroying humankind. The leader of these creatures, the Nameless One, has been trapped in the Abyss for ages after having been severely wounded by the sword Ascalon wielded by Galian Berethnet. These events brought about the current order: Virtudom, the kingdom set up by Berethnet, is a pious society that considers all dragons evil. In the East, dragons are worshiped as gods—but not the fire-breathing type. These dragons channel the power of water and are said to be born of stars.</p>
                <p>A celebration of fantasy that melds modern ideology with classic tropes. More of these dragons, please.</p>

                                                    The master of horror hits his absolute low with this lazy adaptation of "Leon" the "Professional".  This is a very uninspiring , unnecessarily drawn out story about a hitman, saving a girl, who in turn, turns his life around and gives him a reason to live, right before he dies... There is no twists or turns that you do not see coming from a mile away. Also, the writer does not hide his political affiliations in the slightest, shoving them down your throat and making you feel like a complete scumbag, just for having a different political opinion. And don't get me started with the laziest fan service I've ever seen: is mere mentioning of "The Overlook" supposed to make us salivate?... What was the point of that?... "The Shining" was one of his best novels, and he just shoves it in here pretty much saying: "remember that you guys and how great it was, well this is just like that..." Except,  it is not... it feels very out of place, just as his political rants... Stephen King used to be my favorite author for the past 30 years, but with this blatant cash grab he managed to lose any and all respect I have had held for this once great writer.

                                                    Slow talking, quick thinking Billy Summers presents himself as a blunt instrument to the mobsters who hired Billy to kill a mark. His record speaks for itself: Never caught and never suspected, he's had clean getaways. He knows he's been clever, but also lucky. As all successful gamblers know, his luck will run out. So, this is Billy's last job before retirement. He has no intention of getting caught.

                                                    An enjoyable book. Good characters, moves along slow at times, but has decent suspense for a thriller to keep you going. Some of the plot is predictable, most is original and interesting. 
                                                    Like many others commented, the politics / liberal slant doesn't add to the story. It's not a big part of the story, but it has no place in it (please move on from trump, your best work didn't have this much overtones of politics).
